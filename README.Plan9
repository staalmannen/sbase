This is a "spoon" of suckless.org sbase for building sbase for Plan9 (APE).
The purpose is to provide some more "unixy" utilities for APE that will be 
able to handle certain configure scripts better than the ones currently
on Plan9.


Building is easy.
Just do "mk install"

I have enabled the targets that build in the mkfile_bin
